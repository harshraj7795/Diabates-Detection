# Diabates-Detection
Prediction of onset of Diabates based on diagnostic measures
The dataset used is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

The diagnostic measures in the dataset comprise of No. of Pregnancies, Glucose Level(mg/dL), Blood Pressure(mm Hg), Skin Thickness(mm), Insulin Level(mu U/ml), BMI(weight in kg/(height in m)^2) and Age(years)
